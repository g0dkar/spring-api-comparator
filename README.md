# spring-api-comparator

A Spring Framework Plugin/Library that tries to compare an API endpoint response to another API endpoint.

This was born from an idea at work, where people were splitting a Monolith into microservices and wanted to make sure
the microservices responses were the same as the ones sent by the Monolith :)
